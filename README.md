This is a basic chess-app, work in progress. 

To run it locally you first have to clone the repository. You can do so either 

via ssh 
`$ git clone git@github.com:Nrin3141/chess-app.git`

or via https
`$ git clone https://github.com/Nrin3141/chess-app.git`

Next you have to install everything, otherwise the $ meteor command won't work. 
Installing can be done via

`$ meteor npm install`

then you should be able to run the `$ meteor` command, which starts the application in your browser at localhost:3000.
